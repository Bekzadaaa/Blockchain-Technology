# Smart Contract Development and Deployment

## Objective
The goal of this practical lesson is to gain basic skills in smart contract development, deployment, and interaction.

## Tools Used
- MetaMask
- Remix IDE
- Ethereum Sepolia Test Network

## Smart Contract
The smart contract stores a message on the blockchain.

Functions:
- `message` — public variable to read the stored message
- `setMessage(string)` — updates the message value
- `constructor(string)` — sets the initial message during deployment

## Deployment
- Network: Sepolia Test Network
- Deployment method: Remix IDE with MetaMask
- Initial message: "Hello, Blockchain!"

## Interaction
1. The message value was read using the public variable.
2. The message was updated using the `setMessage` function.
3. The transaction was confirmed via MetaMask.
4. The updated value was successfully stored on the blockchain.

## Conclusion
The smart contract was successfully deployed and interacted with.
The blockchain acts as a single source of truth, and MetaMask is used to sign and send transactions.
